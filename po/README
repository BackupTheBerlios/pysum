/usr/share/locale/ on a GNU/Linux, but on Solaris it is
/usr/lib/locale)

gtranslator or launchpad) and next generate a *.mo file. You should
copy the *.mo file into your locate directory (on GNU/Linux:
locatedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo). For example, if you use a
translation into Spanish, copy the *.mo file to:
/usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
