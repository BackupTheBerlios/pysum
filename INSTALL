 Translations (optional)

This project uses Launchpad for translations. In Launchpad you
can find translations for more languages.

The translations that exist in /po directory is obtained from
launchpad, for details of translators visit:
https://translations.launchpad.net/pysum

This project and its developers are not responsible for the
content of the translations.


---------------------------------
 Install Translations (optional)
---------------------------------

The program use the default directory for translations (usually
/usr/share/locale/ on a GNU/Linux, but on Solaris it is
/usr/lib/locale)

You can translate the *.pot or *.po file (using poEdit, KBabel,
gtranslator or launchpad) and next generate a *.mo file. You
should copy the *.mo file into your locate directory (on 
GNU/Linux: locatedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo).
For example, if you use a translation into Spanish, copy the
*.mo file to: /usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
