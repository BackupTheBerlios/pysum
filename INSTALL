== Depends ==

pysum depends on the Python runtime and associated libraries.

Python (>= 2.5) : http://www.python.org
PyGTK (>= 2.8) : http://www.pygtk.org

== Run Source code (without installing) ==

You can find the source code of pysum in /src. To run (without
installing), in a terminal use the following syntax:

$ cd src
$ python pysum.py

== Install (manually)==

Copy the files in /src and /img directory to any other directory
you like (for example in your home, in /usr/share, etc.)


Note 1:
-------
To work the pysum.glade file must be in the same directory as
pysum.py OR ELSE you have to edit the value of GUI_DIR specifying
the location of the directory in where the pysum.glade file is
found (aprox. lines 24-25 in /src/pysum.py), defaut value is
GUI_DIR = "/usr/share/pysum"

Note 2:
-------
The images and icons for the program (pysum.png, pysum.svg,...)
must be in the /img directory or in the same directory as pysum.py

For example if you put the script in: /home/user/foo/pysum.py and
the program needs open the image "pysum.png", the program will try
to open the image in the following locations (in this order):

1)  IMG_DIR value (by default: /usr/share/pysum/pysum.png)
2)  /home/user/foo/img/pysum.png
3)  /home/user/foo/pysum.png
4)  /home/user/img/pysum.png

If you need to establish a different location, please edit the value
of IMG_DIR specifying the location of the directory (aprox. lines 
27-28 in src/pysum.py), defaut value is IMG_DIR = "/usr/share/pysum/"

 Translations (optional)
-------------------------

This project uses Launchpad for translations. In Launchpad you
can find translations for more languages.

The translations that exist in /po directory is obtained from
launchpad, for details of translators visit:
https://translations.launchpad.net/pysum

This project and its developers are not responsible for the
content of the translations.


---------------------------------
 Install Translations (optional)
---------------------------------

The program use the default directory for translations (usually
/usr/share/locale/ on a GNU/Linux, but on Solaris it is
/usr/lib/locale)

You can translate the *.pot or *.po file (using poEdit, KBabel,
gtranslator or launchpad) and next generate a *.mo file. You
should copy the *.mo file into your locate directory (on 
GNU/Linux: locatedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo).
For example, if you use a translation into Spanish, copy the
*.mo file to: /usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
